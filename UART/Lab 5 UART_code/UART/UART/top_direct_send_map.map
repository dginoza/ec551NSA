WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   clk_div/clk_sampling_internal is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    76 out of   2,278    3%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                       56 out of   4,556    1%

      to control set restrictions:              53 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
